# Surf's Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to familarize with SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask and to build on our knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods.  We analyzed weather in Oahu for an investor who is looking to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop, but is concerned about the amount of precipitation so we used SQLAlchemy to query the SQLite database of Oahu weather data.
