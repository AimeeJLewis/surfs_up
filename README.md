# Surf's Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to familarize with SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask and to build on our knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods.  We analyzed weather in Oahu for an investor who is looking to open a Surf and Ice Cream shop, but is concerned about the amount of precipitation so we used SQLAlchemy to query the SQLite database of Oahu weather data.

When taking into consideration the precipitation for both the month of June and December, we find that the mean precipitations are very similar as well with June at .14 and December at .22. The months are pretty similar in regards to weather - there isn't any data that would suggest that the investor shouldn't open up his shop.  The weather on Oahu supports a Ice-Cream and Surf shop being open year-round.
